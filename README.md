### Generators Module

This project includes a generators.py module that provides several utility functions for managing transactions and generating card numbers.

#### Functions

1. transaction_descriptions

   A generator function that cycles through transaction descriptions for given transactions.
   
   Example Usage:

   
python
   from src.generators import transaction_descriptions

   transactions = [
       {'id': 1, 'amount': 100, 'currency': 'USD'},
       {'id': 2, 'amount': 200, 'currency': 'EUR'}
   ]

   descriptions = transaction_descriptions(transactions)

   for _ in range(4):
       print(next(descriptions))
   # Output:
   # Перевод организации
   # Перевод со счета на счет
   # Перевод с карты на карту
   # Перевод организации
   


2. card_number_generator

   A generator function that generates sequential card numbers between a given start and end.

   Example Usage:

   
python
   from src.generators import card_number_generator

   start = "0000 0000 0000 0001"
   end = "0000 0000 0000 0010"

   numbers = card_number_generator(start, end)

   for number in numbers:
       print(number)
   # Output:
   # 0000 0000 0000 0001
   # 0000 0000 0000 0002
   # ...
   # 0000 0000 0000 0010

Pytest Cache Directory
>>>>>>> 5de7b15c230b6f6b19367facd7fca70826de7015
The pytest cache directory contains data from the pytest cache plugin. This data supports the --lf (run last failed tests) and --ff (run tests from the cache, starting with the last failed ones) options, as well as the cache fixture.

Do not commit the pytest cache directory to version control.

For more information about pytest caching, refer to the official documentation.

To clear the pytest cache, use the following command:

<<<<<<< HEAD
bash
pytest --cache-clear


Make sure to exclude the .pytest_cache/ directory from your version control system, typically by adding it to your .gitignore file.
